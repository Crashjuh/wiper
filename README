== WARNING ==

This set of ugly hacks is DESIGNED TO DESTROY DATA. Do not run on any system
that contains data that you wish to keep. In fact, just don't use these scripts
at all. :-)

== What does it do? ==

Overwrite block devices, that were inserted after the boot process has
finished, with nullbytes.

== Installation ==

Put it on a clean Debian system. We use a USB stick.

cp rc.local /etc
cp wiper progress /usr/local/bin
cp 99-wiper.rules /etc/udev/rules.d

== Usage ==

Just insert disks. To watch the progress, run:

    watch progress

Cute, huh? Whenever the kernel messages mess up the screen, just do a ^C and
restart watch.

== License ==

Any OSI.
